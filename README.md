This repo contains a command to run a given number of iterations a universe filled randomly.

A cellular automata (CA) is a 4-tuple containing
* universe
* set of states
* neighborhood
* transition function

The elementary CA correspond to those CA in which the universe is 1-dimensional, the set of states is ${0,1}$, and the neighborhood consists of the cell ant its two closes neighbors.
For the transition function, it is given by the binary representation of the rule.
This is known as the Wolfram notation,
